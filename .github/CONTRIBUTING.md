### Contributing

Contributions to Pwndbg are always welcome! If you want to get more familiar with project idea/structure/whatever - [here are some developer notes](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/dev/DEVELOPING.md). If something is not clear, feel free to ask either in a GitHub issue or on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x47DssnGwm)!

If you want to help, fork the project, hack your changes and create a pull request.

If this is something big/new feature or a bug, consider creating an issue first.


Some guides:
* [Fork a project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

### Versioning and releases

* We use only one branch: `dev` and create tags for releases
* Each developer works on his own fork
* Releases occur on predetermined schedule
* Bugs _are not fixed_ on releases: they are merged to dev branch and will be released with a new tag/release
