### Description

<!--
Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs.
-->

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
What do we have to do to reproduce the problem?
If this is connected to particular C/asm code, 
please provide the smallest C code that reproduces the issue.
-->

### My setup

<!--
Show us your gdb/python/pwndbg/OS/IDA Pro version (depending on your case).

NOTE: We are currently supporting only Ubuntu installations.
It is known that pwndbg is not fully working e.g. on Arch Linux (the heap stuff is not working there).
If you would like to change this situation - help us improving pwndbg and supporting other distros!

This can be displayed in pwndbg through `version` command.

If it is somehow unavailable, use:
* `show version` - for gdb
* `py import sys; print(sys.version)` - for python
* pwndbg version/git commit id
