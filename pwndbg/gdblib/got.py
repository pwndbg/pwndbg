"""
Global Offset Table Tracker

Subsystem for tracking accesses to external function calls made through pointers
in an inferior's Global Offset Table, such as those made by the stubs in the
Procedure Linkage Table.

Currently, it does this by attatching watchpoints to the entries in the GOT and
taking note of where the call came from, but it could be done much faster by
injecting our own code into the program space to track this.
