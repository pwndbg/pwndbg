    This context manager can be used to run GDB commands with threads scheduling
    being locked which means that other threads will be stopped during execution.

    This is useful to prevent bugs where e.g.: gdb.parse_and_eval("(int)foo()")
    would execute foo() on the current debugee thread but would also unlock other
    threads for being executed and those other threads may for example hit a
    breakpoint we set previously which would be confusing for the user.
