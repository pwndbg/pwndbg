# When single stepping in Unicorn with MIPS, the address it arrives at in Unicorn
# is often incorrect with branches.
# This is due to "Delay slots" - the instruction AFTER a branch is always executed
# before the jump, and the Unicorn emulator respects this behavior.
# This causes single stepping branches to not arrive at the correct instruction -
# it will simply go to the next location in memory, not respecting the branch. It doesn't appear to be extremely consistent.
# Unicorn doesn't have a workaround for this single stepping issue:
# https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/332
#
# The way to fix the issue this causes (incorrect instruction.next) is by implementing the
# condition function to manually specify when a jump is taken. Our manual decision will override the emulator.
