Heap Tracking

This module implements runtime tracking of the heap, allowing pwndbg to detect
heap related misbehavior coming from an inferior in real time, which lets us
catch UAF bugs, double frees (and more), and report them to the user.

# Approach
The approach used starting with using breakpoints to hook into the following
libc symbols: `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. Each hook has a
reference to a shared instance of the `Tracker` class, which is responsible for
handling the tracking of the chunks of memory from the heap.

The tracker keeps two sorted maps of chunks, for freed and in use chunks, keyed
by their base address. Newly allocated chunks are added to the map of in use
chunks right before an allocating call returns, and newly freed chunks are moved
from the map of in use chunks to the map of free ones right before a freeing
call returns. The tracker is also responsible for installing watchpoints for
free chunks when they're added to the free chunk map and deleting them when
their corresponding chunks are removed from the map.

Additionally, because going through the data structures inside of libc to
determine whether a chunk is free or not is, more often than not, a fairly slow
operation, this module will only do so when it determines its view of the chunks
has diverged from the one in libc in a way that would affect behavior. When such
a diffence is detected, this module will rebuild the chunk maps in the range it
determines to have been affected.

Currently, the way it does this is by deleting and querying from libc the new
status of all chunks that overlap the region of a new allocation when it detects
that allocation overlaps chunks it previously considered free.

This approach lets us avoid a lot of the following linked lists that comes with
trying to answer the allocation status of a chunk, by keeping at hand as much
known-good information as possible about them. Keep in mind that, although it is
much faster than going to libc every time we need to know the allocation status
of a chunk, this approach does have drawbacks when it comes to memory usage.

# Compatibility
Currently module assumes the inferior is using GLibc.

There are points along the code in this module where the assumptions it makes
are explicitly documented and checked to be valid for the current inferior, so
that it may be immediately clear to the user that something has gone wrong if
they happen to not be valid. However, be aware that there may be assumptions
that were not made explicit.
