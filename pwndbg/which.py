def which(name, all = False):
    """which(name, flags = os.X_OK, all = False) -> str or str set

    Works as the system command ``which``; searches $PATH for ``name`` and
    returns a full path if found.

    If `all` is :const:`True` the set of all found locations is returned, else
    the first occurrence or :const:`None` is returned.

    Arguments:
      `name` (str): The file to search for.
      `all` (bool):  Whether to return all locations where `name` was found.

    Returns:
      If `all` is :const:`True` the set of all locations where `name` was found,
      else the first location or :const:`None` if not found.

    Example:
      >>> which('sh')
      '/bin/sh'
