        breakpoints, while `WatchpointLocation` locations yield watchpoints.

        the breakpoint or whatchpoint is hit, and that determines whether

        a signal to continue execution. The extent of the actions that may be
        taken during the stop handler is determined by the debugger.

        Breakpoints and watchpoints marked as `one_shot` are removed after they
        are first triggered. For the purposes of `one_shot`, a breakpoint or
        watchpoint that has a stop handler is only considered to be triggered

          changes to the memory of the process being debugged.

        - `CONTINUE`: This event is fired after the user has requested for
          process execution to continue after it had been previously suspended.

          been encountered by the debugger. This usually happens when a new
          application module is loaded into the memory space of the process being
